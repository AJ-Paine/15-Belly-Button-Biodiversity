# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

## About
This repository is for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp Plotly challenge homework.

In this assignment, I used D3 and Plotly in javascript to build an interactive dashboard that explores microbes from different sample's bellybuttons.  The dataset is stored in a local JSON file, which I had to access by using a local server via Python.

The dashboard includes a dropdown menu to select which sample to plot, a scatter plot that has its markers size and color determined by characteristics of each sample, a panel displaying background information of the selected sample, and a horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 occuring bacteria in selected sample's belly button.

## Built With
* Javascript
* Plotly
* D3
* HTML
* CSS
* Python local server
